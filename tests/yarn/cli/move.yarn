Move cards between lanes in a toucan board
==========================================

Check a correct move between two lanes
--------------------------------------

    SCENARIO move a card from one lane to a different lane

    GIVEN    a toucan board for moving cards
    AND      a card uuid

    WHEN     running "toucan move card/uuid lane/doing"

    THEN     the card now has a reference to a lane with name "Doing"
    AND      the lane with name "Backlog" now has no reference in the list "cards" to the moved card
    AND      the lane with name "Doing" now has a reference in the list "cards" to the moved card

Check for error handling when the card is already in the lane
-------------------------------------------------------------

    SCENARIO move a card from one lane to the same lane

    GIVEN    a toucan board for moving cards
    AND      a card uuid

    WHEN     running "toucan move card/uuid lane/backlog"

    THEN     the card now has a reference to a lane with name "Backlog"
    AND      the lane with name "Backlog" now has a reference in the list "cards" to the moved card
    AND      the output includes an error which says "Did not move card"

Check for error handling when the card does not exist
-----------------------------------------------------

    SCENARIO move a non-existant card to a lane

    GIVEN    a toucan board for moving cards
    AND      a fake uuid

    WHEN     running "toucan move card/uuid lane/doing"

    THEN     the output includes an error which says "Did not move card"

Check for error handling when the lane does not exist
-----------------------------------------------------

    SCENARIO move a card to a non-existant lane

    GIVEN    a toucan board for moving cards
    AND      a card uuid

    WHEN     running "toucan move card/uuid lane/notalane"

    THEN     the lane with name "Backlog" now has a reference in the list "cards" to the moved card
    AND      the card now has a reference to a lane with name "Backlog"
    AND      the output includes an error which says "Did not move card"
